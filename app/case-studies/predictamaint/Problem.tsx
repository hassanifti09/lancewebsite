        <h5 className="text-xl text-left">
          OSDCORB Tyres, a leading global tyre manufacturer, faced a critical challenge that threatened its production efficiency and profitability: frequent, unpredictable equipment downtime. Their extensive manufacturing facilities relied on complex machinery, and unexpected breakdowns led to significant production halts, missed deadlines, and escalating maintenance costs. The traditional reactive maintenance approach meant repairs were initiated only after a failure occurred, resulting in prolonged periods of inactivity, wasted resources, and a constant struggle to meet demand. This lack of foresight not only impacted their bottom line but also strained their operational teams and jeopardized their market position. OSDCORB recognized the urgent need for a proactive solution to minimize disruptions and optimize their maintenance strategy.
