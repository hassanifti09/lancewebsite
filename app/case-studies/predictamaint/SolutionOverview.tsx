        <h5 className="text-xl text-left">
          We partnered with OSDCORB Tyres to design and implement a bespoke AI-powered predictive maintenance system, a transformative solution aimed at revolutionizing their operational efficiency. Our approach involved leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time data streams from critical machinery, including vibration, temperature, pressure, and operational cycles. This system was engineered to move OSDCORB from a reactive to a proactive maintenance paradigm, enabling them to anticipate equipment failures before they occurred and schedule interventions precisely when needed, minimizing disruption and maximizing asset lifespan.
