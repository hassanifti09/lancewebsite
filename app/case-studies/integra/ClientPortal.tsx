          To specifically address the complexities of servicing international clients, our software introduced a sophisticated client portal and collaborative workspaces. This feature provided Integra&apos;s clients with unprecedented transparency into project progress, allowing for real-time feedback, document sharing, and milestone tracking in a secure, branded environment. Furthermore, the platform&apos;s multilingual support and localized data compliance features ensured that Integra could cater to the specific needs and regulatory requirements of each region they operated in. This direct digital link fostered stronger client relationships, enhanced trust, and significantly streamlined the feedback and approval processes, which were previously managed through cumbersome email chains and multiple file-sharing services.
