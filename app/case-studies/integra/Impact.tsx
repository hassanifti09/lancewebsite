          The culmination of these targeted digital interventions was a profound transformation of Integra&apos;s operational capabilities and competitive standing. The newly digitized platforms drove a significant increase in project efficiency, reduced administrative overhead, and enabled a more agile and responsive approach to client service. Data that was once siloed within regional offices was now aggregated to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making at the highest level. Ultimately, our partnership empowered Integra to not only overcome the challenges of their global scale but to turn it into a distinct strategic advantage, solidifying their reputation as a forward-thinking leader in the management consulting industry.
