          Our engagement began with a deep-dive analysis of Integra's multifaceted operations, identifying critical pressure points in their client lifecycle and internal project management. The primary intervention centered on the deployment of a bespoke, cloud-native platform designed to serve as the central nervous system for their entire global network. This foundational step replaced their disparate CRM and project management tools with a single, integrated solution. This new digital backbone provided a panoramic view of all client interactions, project statuses, and resource allocations across the globe, ensuring that every consultant, regardless of their location, was operating from a single source of truth.
