          Internally, the challenge of managing inter-office workflows was met with our advanced collaboration and knowledge management modules. We implemented smart resource allocation tools that allowed project managers to identify and assign the best-suited consultants from across the globe based on expertise, availability, and language skills. A centralized knowledge repository, powered by machine learning, enabled consultants to easily access and share best practices, case studies, and market intelligence, breaking down geographical barriers to innovation. This fostered a more cohesive global culture and empowered Integra to bring the full weight of its collective expertise to bear on every client engagement, transforming a distributed network of offices into a truly integrated global team.
