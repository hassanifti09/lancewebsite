          Integra, a global management consulting firm renowned for its strategic insights, found its operational agility increasingly constrained by a patchwork of legacy systems. The firmâ€™s expansive global presence, while a testament to its success, created significant hurdles in servicing a diverse international clientele and managing seamless inter-office collaboration. The lack of a unified digital platform led to fragmented data, inefficient workflows, and communication silos between their international offices. This technological dissonance hampered their ability to leverage their global talent pool effectively and deliver the cohesive, data-driven solutions their clients expected. Recognizing that their continued growth was contingent on digital innovation, Integra sought a strategic partner to architect and implement a comprehensive digital transformation.
